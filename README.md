## ChangePrinterOrient


</div>

### Description

NEW NOTE: FROM VB6 SP4 MICROSOFT HAVE ADDED A NEW PROPERTY TO THE DATAREPORT (orientation) WHICH HAS THE SAME EFFECT. SO MY CODE MAY NOT BE REQUIRED.

Using VB6 DataReport writer I hit a problem where it didn't allow landscape reports unless the default printer was already set to landscape. I didn't want my users to change there printers so I wrote this function to change the printer orientation to Landscape or Portrait. Calling it before I opened my report.
 
### More Info
 
Changes the default printer to Landscape or Portrait for the Whole of Windows. Be sure to reset it after printing.
